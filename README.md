Whistle blower is a revolutionary mobile platform to aid in fighting corruption. It has an android app that 
can take pictures, record videos and audio as well as take a note and on clicking upload, the it is posted 
on a website designed specifically  for 
Whistle blowing purposes. This is a naive approach to curb corruption practises in Kenya today. It is
also my final year project for my Computer Science degree.
